# btree
B-tree storage of sets with configurable I/O.

This implements B-trees of any order >= 2 in Erlang.

I/O is handled by user-provided callbacks.  One possibility
is to embed a B-tree inside another storage structure.

Only sets (keys without data) are supported.

## Implementation notes

- Initially based on [Wirth76].
- Converted from Pascal to C, and then to Erlang.  The Erlang
  version uses tuples in lieu of arrays.  Pages are of variable
  not fixed size.
- I/O of pages is made explicit.
- Search is separated from insertion.  Search returns a stack of
  pages and indices recording the path from the root to the key.
  Insertion uses that stack to navigate the tree when rewriting it.
- Deletion is tricky enough that the recursive structure of the
  original code is kept as-is.  A local cache is used to avoid
  redundant I/O.
- Our use cases only want sets, so this does not associate
  attributes with the keys.
- Bulk-loading into an empty tree has been added.
